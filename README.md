## Towards Geometric and Textural Consistency 3D Scene Generation via Single Image-guided Model Generation and Layout Optimization 😊

> Our framework can be considered as a decomposition-composition approach: a 3D instance generation method via image decomposition and inpainting is proposed for guiding the foreground objects generation, which ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy even if the objects in the guidance image are occluded. An instance point cloud extraction phase collaborates with Chamfer distance loss minimization, which not only overcomes the instability of 3D instance generation, but also ensures the spatial layout of generated scene aligns highly with the reference image.
